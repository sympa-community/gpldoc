# NAME

Sympa::WWW::SharedDocument - Shared document repository and its nodes

# SYNOPSIS

    use Sympa::WWW::SharedDocument;
    
    $shared = Sympa::WWW::SharedDocument->new($list, $path);
    
    %access = $shared->get_privileges('read', $email, 'md5', {...});
    @children = $shared->get_children;
    $parent = $shared->{parent};

# DESCRIPTION

[Sympa::WWW::SharedDocument](./Sympa-WWW-SharedDocument.3.md) implements shared document repository of lists.

## Methods

- new ( $list, \[ $path, \[ allow\_empty => 1 \] \] )

    _Constructor_.
    Creates new instance.

    Parameters:

    - $list

        A [Sympa::List](./Sympa-List.3.md) instance.

    - $path

        String to determine path or arrayref of path components.
        The path is relative to repository root.

    - allow\_empty => 1

        Don't omit files with zero size.

    Returns:

    If $path is empty or not specified, returns new instance of repository root;
    {status} attribute will be set.
    If $path is not empty and the path exists, returns new instance of node.
    Otherwise returns false value.

- as\_hashref ( )

    _Instance method_.
    Casts the instance to hashref.

    Parameters:

    None.

    Returns:

    A hashref including attributes of instance (see ["Attributes"](#attributes))
    and following special items:

    - {ancestors}

        Arrayref of hashrefs including some attributes of all ancestor nodes.

    - {context}

        Hashref including name and host of the list.

    - {date}

        Localized form of {date\_epoch}.

    - {parent}

        Hashref including attributes of parent node recursively.

    - {paths\_d}

        Same as {paths} but, if the node is a directory, includes additional empty
        component at the end.
        This is useful when the path created by join() should be followed by
        additional "/" character.

- count\_children ( )

    _Instance method_.
    Returns number of child nodes.

- count\_moderated\_descendants ( )

    _Instance method_.
    Returns number of nodes waiting for moderation.

- create\_child ( $name, owner => $email, scenario => $scenario,
type => $type, \[ content => $content \] )

    _Instance method_.
    Creates child node and returns it.
    TBD.

- get\_children ( \[ moderate => boolean \], \[ name => $name \],
\[ order\_by => $order \], \[ owner => $email \], \[ allow\_empty => 1 \] )

    _Instance method_.
    Gets child nodes.

    Parameters:

    - moderate => boolean
    - name => $name
    - owner => $email

        Filters results.

    - order\_by => $order

        Sorts results.
        $order may be one of
        `'order_by_doc'` (by name of nodes),
        `'order_by_author'` (by owner),
        `'order_by_size'` (by size),
        `'order_by_date'` (by modification time).
        Default is ordering by names.

    - allow\_empty => 1

        Don't omit nodes with zero size.

    Returns:

    (Possibly empty) list of child nodes.

- get\_moderated\_descendants ( )

    _Instance method_.
    Returns the list of nodes waiting for moderation.

    Parameters:

    None.

    Returns:

    In array context, a list of nodes.
    In scalar context, an arrayref of them.

- get\_privileges ( mode => $mode, sender => $sender,
auth\_method => $auth\_method, scenario\_context => $scenario\_context )

    _Instance method_.
    Gets privileges of a user on the node.

    TBD.

- get\_size ( )

    _Instance method_.
    Gets total size under current node.

- install ( )

    _Instance method_.
    Approves (install) file if it was held for moderation.

        The name to be renamed to.

    Returns:

    True value.
    If renaming failed, returns false value and sets $ERRNO ($!).

- rmdir ( )

    _instance method_.
    Removes directory from repository.
    Directory must be empty.

    Returns:

    True value.
    If removal failed, returns false value and sets $ERRNO ($!).

- save\_description ( )

    _Instance method_.
    Creates or updates property description of the node.

- unlink ( )

    _instance method_.
    Removes file from repository.

    Returns:
