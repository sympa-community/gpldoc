# DESCRIPTION

This module is the base class for spool subclasses of Sympa.

## Public methods

- new ( \[ options... \] )

    _Constructor_.
    Creates new instance of the class.

- marshal ( $message, \[ keep\_keys => 1 \] )

    _Instance method_.
    Gets marshalled key (file name) of the message.

    Parameters:

    - $message

        Message to be marshalled.

    - keep\_keys => 1

        See marshal\_metadata().

- next ( \[ no\_filter => 1 \], \[ no\_lock => 1 \] )

    _Instance method_.
    Gets next message to process, order is controlled by name of spool file and
    so on.
    Message will be locked to prevent multiple processing of a single message.

    Parameters:

    - no\_filter => 1

        Won't skip messages when filter defined by \_filter() returns false.

    - no\_lock => 1

        Won't lock messages.

    Returns:

    Two-elements list of message instance and filehandle locking
    a message.
    If parsing message fails, list of `undef` and filehandle.
    If no more message found, empty array.

    If `no_lock` is set,
    true scalar value will be returned in place of filehandle.

- quarantine ( $handle )

    _Instance method_.
    Quarantines a message.
    On filesystem spool,
    message will be moved into `{bad_directory}` of the spool using rename().

    Parameter:

    - $handle

        Filehandle, [Sympa::LockedFile](./Sympa-LockedFile.3.md) instance, locking message.

    Returns:

    True value if message could be quarantined.
    Otherwise false value.

    If $handle was not a filehandle, this method will die.

- remove ( $handle )

    _Instance method_.
    Removes a message.

    Parameter:

    - $handle

        Filehandle, [Sympa::LockedFile](./Sympa-LockedFile.3.md) instance, locking message.

    Returns:

    True value if message could be removed.
    Otherwise false value.

    If $handle was not a filehandle, this method will die.

- size ( )

    _Instance method_.
    Gets the number of messages the spool contains.

    Parameters:

    None.

    Returns:

    Number of messages.

    Note:
    This method returns the number of messages \_load() returns,
    not applying \_filter().

- store ( $message, \[ original => $original \] )

    _Instance method_.
    Stores the message into spool.

    Parameters:

    - $message

        Message to be stored.

    - original => $original

        If true value is specified and $message was decrypted,
        Stores original encrypted form.

    Returns:

    If storing succeeded, marshalled metadata (file name) of the message.
    Otherwise `undef`.

- unmarshal ( $marshalled )

    _Instance method_.
    Gets metadata from marshalled key (file name).

    Parameters:

    - $marshalled

        Marshalled key.

    Returns:

    Hashref containing metadata.

## Properties

Instance of [Sympa::Spool](./Sympa-Spool.3.md) may have following properties.

- Directories

    Directories \_directories() method returns:
    `{directory}`, `{bad_directory}` and so on.

## Low level functions

- build\_glob\_pattern ( $marshal\_format, $marshal\_keys,
\[ key => value, ... \] )

    _Function_.
    Builds a glob pattern from parameters and returns it.
    If built pattern is empty or contains only punctuations,
    i.e. `[^0-9A-Za-z\x80-\xFF]`, will return `undef`.

- split\_listname ( $robot, $localpart )

    _Function_.
    Split local part of e-mail to list name and type.
    Returns an array `(name, type)`.
    Note that the list with returned name may or may not exist.

    If local part looks like listmaster or sympa address, name is `undef` and
    type is either `'listmaster'` or `'sympa'`.
    Otherwise, type is either `'editor'`, `'owner'`, `'return_path'`,
    `'subscribe'`, `'unsubscribe'`, `'UNKNOWN'` or `undef`.

    Note:
    For `-request` and `-owner` suffix, this function returns
    `owner` and `return_path` types, respectively.

- store\_spool ( $spool\_dir, $message, $marshal\_format, $marshal\_keys,
\[ key => value, ... \] )

    _Function_.
    Store $message into directory $spool\_dir as a file with name as
    marshalled metadata using $marshal\_format and $marshal\_keys.

- unmarshal\_metadata ( $spool\_dir, $marshalled,
$marshal\_regexp, $marshal\_keys )

    _Function_.
    Unmarshals metadata.
    Returns hashref with keys in arrayref $marshal\_keys
    and values with substrings captured by regexp $marshal\_regexp.
    If $marshalled did not match against $marshal\_regexp,
    returns `undef`.

    The keys `localpart` and `domainpart` are special.
    Following keys are derived from them:
    `context`, `listname`, `listtype`, `priority`.

- marshal\_metadata ( $message, $marshal\_format, $marshal\_keys,
\[ keep\_keys => 1 \] )

    _Function_.
    Marshals metadata.
    Returns formatted string by sprintf() using $marshal\_format
    and metadatas indexed by keys in arrayref $marshal\_keys.

    If key is uppercase, it means auto-generated value:
    `'AUTHKEY'`, `'KEYAUTH'`, `'PID'`, `'RAND'`, `'TIME'`.
    Otherwise it means metadata or property of $message.
    If `keep_keys` option (added on 6.2.23b) is set, forces using latter.

    sprintf() is executed under `C` locale:
    Full stop (`.`) is always used for decimal point in floating point number.

## Methods subclass should implement

- \_create ( )

    _Instance method_, _overridable_.
    Creates spool.
    By default, creates directories returned by \_directories().

- \_directories ( \[ options, ... \] )

    _Class or instance method_, _mandatory for filesystem spool_.
    Returns hashref with directory paths related to the spool as values.
    It must have keys at least `directory` and
    (if you wish to implement quarantine() method) `bad_directory`.

- \_filter ( $metadata )

    _Instance method_, _overridable_.
    If it returned false value, processing of $metadata by next() will be skipped.
    By default, always returns true value.

    This method may modify unmarshalled metadata \_and\_ deserialized messages
    include it.

- \_filter\_pre ( $metadata )

    _Instance method_, _overridable_.
    If it returned false value, processing of $metadata by store() will be
    skipped.
    By default, always returns true value.

    This method may modify marshalled metadata \_but\_ stored messages are not
    affected.

- \_generator ( )

    _Class or instance method_, _mandatory_.
    Returns name of the class to serialize and deserialize messages in the spool.
    If spool subclass is the collection (see \_is\_collection),
    generator class must implement new().
    Otherwise,
    generator class must implement dup(), new() and to\_string().

- \_glob\_pattern ( )

    Deprecated.  See \_no\_glob\_pattern ( )

- \_init ( $state )

    _Instance method_.
    Additional processing when \_load() returns no contents ($state is 1) or
    when the spool class is instantiated ($state is 0).

- \_is\_collection ( )

    _Instance method_, _overridable_.
    If the class is collection of spool class, returns true value.
    By default returns false value.

    Collection class does not have store() method.
    Its content is the set of spool instances.

- \_load ( )

    _Instance method_, _overridable_.
    Loads sorted content of spool.
    Returns arrayref of marshalled metadatas.
    By default, returns content of `{directory}` directory sorted by file name.

- \_marshal\_format ( )
- \_marshal\_keys ( )
- \_marshal\_regexp ( )

    _Instance methods_, _mandatory for filesystem spool_.
    \_marshal\_format() and \_marshal\_keys() are used to marshal metadata.
    \_marshal\_keys() and \_marshal\_regexp() are used to unmarshal metadata.
    See also marshal\_metadata() and unmarshal\_metadata().

- \_no\_glob\_pattern ( )

    _Class or instance method_, _overridable for filesystem spool_.
    If it returns false value,
    glob() is used as much as possible to scan the spool faster.
    Otherwise readdir() is used for filesystem spool to get all entries.
    By default returns false value.

- \_store\_key ( )

    _Instance method_.
    If implemented and returns non-empty string,
    store() returns an item in metadata specified by this method.
    By default store() returns marshalled metadata
    (file name on filesystem spool).

## Marshaling and unmarshaling metadata

Spool class gives generator class the **metadata** to instantiate it.
On spool based on filesystem, it is typically encoded into file names.
For example a file name in incoming spool ([Sympa::Spool::Incoming](./Sympa-Spool-Incoming.3.md))

    listname-owner@domain.name.143599229.12345

encodes the metadata

    localpart  => 'listname-owner',
    listname   => 'listname',
    listtype   => 'return_path',
    domainpart => 'domain.name',
    date       => 143599229,

Metadata always includes information of **context**: List, Robot, Site
(or Family).  For example:

\- Message in incoming spool bound for <listname@domain.name>:

    context    => Sympa::List <listname@domain.name>,

\- Command message in incoming spool bound for <sympa@domain.name>:

    context    => 'domain.name',

\- Message sent from Sympa to super-listmaster(s):

    context    => '*'

Context is determined when the generator class is instantiated, and
generally never changed through lifetime of instance.
Thus, constructor of generator class should take context object as an
argument.

`localpart` is encoded in a bit complex manner.

- If the context is Site or Robot, it is a value of `email` parameter,
typically "`sympa`".
- If the context is Family, it is encoded as `@_family name_`.
This encoding was added on Sympa 6.2.53b.
- If the context is List, it is encoded as local part of list address
according to listtype (See also ["get\_address" in Sympa](./Sympa.3.md#get_address)).
