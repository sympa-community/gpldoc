## Context and metadata

Context and metadata given to constructor are accessible as hash elements
of object.
They are given by request spool.
See ["Context and metadata" in Sympa::Spool::Auth](./Sympa-Spool-Auth.3.md#context-and-metadata) for details.

## Attributes

These are accessible as hash elements of objects.
There are attributes including:

- {custom\_attribute}

    Custom attribute connected to requested action.

- {gecos}

    Display name of user sending request.

- {sender}

    E-mail of user who sent the request.

## Serialization

[Sympa::Request](./Sympa-Request.3.md) object includes number of slots as hash items:
**metadata**, **context** and **attributes**.
Metadata including context are given by spool:
See ["Marshaling and unmarshaling metadata" in Sympa::Spool](./Sympa-Spool.3.md#marshaling-and-unmarshaling-metadata).

Logically, objects are stored into physical spool as **serialized form**
and deserialized when they are fetched from spool.
Attributes are encoded in `X-Sympa-*:` pseudo-header fields.

See also ["Serialization" in Sympa::Message](./Sympa-Message.3.md#serialization) for example.
