# NAME

Sympa::DatabaseDriver - Base class of database drivers for Sympa

# SYNOPSIS

    package Sympa::DatabaseDriver::FOO;
    use base qw(Sympa::DatabaseDriver);

# DESCRIPTION

[Sympa::DatabaseDriver](./Sympa-DatabaseDriver.3.md) is the base class of driver classes for
Sympa Database Manager (SDM).

## Instance methods subclasses should implement

- required\_modules ( )

    _Overridable_.
    Returns an arrayref including package name(s) this driver requires.
    By default, no packages are required.

- required\_parameters ( )

    _Overridable_.
    Returns an arrayref including names of required (not optional) parameters.
    By default, returns `['db_name', 'db_user']`.

    _Note_:
    On Sympa prior to 6.2.37b.2, it by default returned
    `['db_host', 'db_name', 'db_user']`.

- optional\_modules ( )

    _Overridable_.
    Returns an arrayref including all name(s) of optional packages.
    By default, there are no optional packages.

    This method was introduced by Sympa 6.2.4.

- optional\_parameters ( )

    _Overridable_.
    Returns an arrayref including all names of optional parameters.
    By default, returns `'db_passwd'`, `'db_port'`, `'db_options'` and so on.

- build\_connect\_string ( )

    _Mandatory for SQL driver_.
    Builds the string to be used by the DBI to connect to the database.

    Parameter:

    None.

    Returns:

    String representing data source name (DSN).

- connect ( )

    _Overridable_.
    Connects to database calling ["\_connect"](#_connect)() and sets database handle.

    Parameter:

    None.

    Returns:

    True value or, if connection failed, false value.

- \_connect ( )

    _Overridable_.
    Connects to database and returns native database handle.

    The default implementation is for [DBI](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBI) database handle.

    Parameter:

    - $value

    Parameter value

    Returns:

    One of:

    - Empty array `()` if arguments were not given.

- AS\_BLOB ( $value )

## Utility method
