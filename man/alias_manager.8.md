# NAME

alias\_manager, alias\_manager.pl - Manage Sympa aliases (Obsoleted)

# OBSOLETED

`alias_manager.pl` was obsoleted as of Sympa 6.2.24, and will be removed
in the future.
To manage aliases based on template, setting "`alias_manager Template`" in
`sympa.conf` or `robot.conf` is recommended.

# SYNOPSIS

`alias_manager.pl` `add` _listname_ _domain_ \[ _file_ \]

`alias_manager.pl` `del` _listname_ _domain_ \[ _file_ \]

# DESCRIPTION

Alias\_manager is a program that helps in installing aliases for newly
created lists and deleting aliases for closed lists. 

Alias management is performed only if it was setup in `/etc/sympa/sympa.conf`
(`sendmail_aliases` configuration parameter).

Administrators using MTA functionalities to manage aliases (i.e.
virtual\_regexp and transport\_regexp with postfix) can disable alias
management by setting
`sendmail_aliases` configuration parameter to `none`.

# OPTIONS

- `del` _listname_ _domain_ \[ _file_ \]

    domain _domain_.
