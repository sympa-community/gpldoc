# NAME

Sympa::Spindle::ProcessHeld - Workflow of message confirmation

# SYNOPSIS

    use Sympa::Spindle::ProcessHeld;

    my $spindle = Sympa::Spindle::ProcessHeld->new(
        confirmed_by => $email, context => $robot, authkey => $key);
    $spindle->spin;

# DESCRIPTION

[Sympa::Spindle::ProcessHeld](./Sympa-Spindle-ProcessHeld.3.md) defines workflow for confirmation of held
messages.

When spin() method is invoked, it reads a message in held message spool,
authorizes it and distribute it if possible.
Either authorization and distribution failed or not, spin() will terminate
processing.
Failed message will be kept in spool and wait for confirmation again.

## Public methods

context => $context, authkey => $key,
\[ quiet => 1 \] )

    new() must take following options:

    - confirmed\_by => $email

        E-mail address of the user who confirmed the message.
